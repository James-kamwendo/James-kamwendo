## 🌐 My Projects

Happy to share this OpenCart Fakestore project I worked on. It's not that complicated or breathtaking 😶‍🌫️ or maybe it is😜. Anyways, I just wanted to say hello world by using very basic JavaScript to work with a simple API 😄 as simple as it is, you probably might know already or have better ways to do it, but sharing is fun 🔃.
