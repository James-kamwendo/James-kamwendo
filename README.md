## 🌐 My Projects

Happy to share this OpenCart Fakestore project I worked on. It's not that complicated or breathtaking 😶‍🌫️ or maybe it is😜. Anyways, I just wanted to say hello world by using very basic JavaScript to work with a simple API 😄 as simple as it is, you probably might know already or have better ways to do it, but sharing is fun 🔃.

### OpenCart Store - Fake Online Store

OpenCart Fakestore is a fictional online store that simply demonstrates how to work with an API, it has features like adding, removing a products or products to a cart, calculating the products costs, viewing product details e.t.c by utilising the fakestore API, JavaScript to handle the logic, HTML and CSS for the UI.
